Here, each of the class, sections has its own name, a numeric name with a short description. In fact, the administrator has to assign a class teacher to each class section. In addition to it, the system also allows the management of class routines. For this, the admin has to a class, day and provide starting and ending times. With it, the users can easily fetch out all the available class routines according to their classes and weekdays.

## Attendance, Examination, Marksheets

Besides, the administrator can manage the markings of each student individually under each available subject. In fact, the administrator has to enter obtained marks with a short comment to it. With all these, the system calculates and generates mark sheets for each student. As a result, the mark sheet contains names of students with their subject, marks, total score with a GPA.

## Fees Payment and Invoice

When it comes to a school management system project, there should also be some attachment of fees with it. And here, this school management system allows collecting fees and maintaining the records of each payment detail. For this, the user simply has to select the name of the student, enter payment name, amount, and select payment mode with status. With all these, the system lists out all the available payment details with each status whether it’s paid or unpaid.

The invoice consists of details such as student name, payment mode, name, amount, status with generated date and time.

## Teacher and Student Panel

The only fact that differentiates them from the administrator and parent panel is that teachers can still make changes to certain sections. Whereas, the student can only view their respective classes, subjects, attendance, class schedules, payment details, and so on.
